# Program-to-calculate-the-area-of-different-shapes-using-polymorphism-and-smart pointers using C++

 1-This program defines a base class `shape` with a virtual function `area()` to calculate the area.

 2- Three derived classes (`circle`, `rectangle`, and `triangle`) override the `area()` function to provide
 
 3- their specific implementations. The program utilizes smart pointers (`unique_ptr`) to manage memory
 
 4- automatically and ensure proper resource cleanup.
 
 5-The program demonstrates polymorphism by calculating the area of different shapes through base class pointers.
